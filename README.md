# BudgeMe Budget Planner

BudgeMe is a budget planner that provides a breakdown of your spending through percentages based on a total budget for a given certain time period. It visualizes these percentages of your budget through use of a pie chart. It then gives you an analysis of your percentage of spending and how close you are to spending on a popular financial model, the 50/30/20.

## Features

- Configure the planner for many popular currencies
- Allows for the user to modify the time period that the budget spans
- Interactive user interface allows for input of spending for time period
- Updates budget remaining as user inputs money spent
- Displays a pie chart based on user data
- Writes an analysis of your spending habits and how close they are to the 50/30/20 model.


### What is the 50/30/20 model?
The 50/30/20 model is a division of your budget into three prime categories: needs, wants, and savings. This means that 50% of your budget should be spent on anyhting deemed needed, 30% should be spent on anything that falls under wants, and 20% of your money should be invested or saved in some way. Following this model will not guarantee financial success but it is a good model to follow. With that being said, personal preference or lifestyle may change these percentages and this is just a recommendation.
